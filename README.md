## 3DCS Parallel Workflow

The purpose of the Simulation analysis is to measure and analyze the variation in the model.  During simulation random variation is applied to the model at the tolerances, hole-pin floats, etc. and the measures are calculated.  This process is repeated a number of times defined by the user.  The multiple results for each measure are then compiled and displayed in the Analysis Window.

This workflow implements distributed parallel executions of 3DCS Monte Carlo simulations and contributor analysis.
